# A simple Q-learning for Taxi Problem from OpenAI-Gym

### Getting Started

This is the environment described in subsection 3.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9905014.pdf).  You can verify that the description in the paper matches the OpenAI Gym environment by peeking at the code [here](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/toy_text/taxi.py).


### Instructions

The repository contains three files:
- `agent.py`: Where I developed the reinforcement learning agent.
- `monitor.py`: The `interact` function tests how well your agent learns from interaction with the environment.
- `main.py`: Run this file in the terminal to check the performance of the agent.

Run the following command in the terminal:
```
python main.py
```
